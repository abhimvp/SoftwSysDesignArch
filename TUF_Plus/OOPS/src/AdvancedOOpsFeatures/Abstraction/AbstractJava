<!-- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and must be inherited by a subclass. It can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).

Abstract methods are those that are declared but not implemented in the abstract class, leaving the actual implementation to be provided by the subclasses. Consider the following code snippet: -->
import java.util.*;
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    // Concrete method
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }

    // Abstract method (no implementation)
    abstract void sound();
}

// Concrete class that extends the abstract class
class Dog extends Animal {
    // Providing implementation for the abstract method
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    // Providing implementation for the abstract method
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("The cat meows.");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog();
        Animal myCat = new Cat();

        myDog.eat();  // Inherited concrete method
        myDog.sound(); // Overridden method in Dog class

        myCat.eat();  // Inherited concrete method
        myCat.sound(); // Overridden method in Cat class
    }
}

<!-- python code -->
