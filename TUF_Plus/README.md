- Low Level Design - `Refer Offline Notes time to time.`
  - Prerequisite - basics of java & OOPs.
  - OOPs - when we want to run a java file , it looks for same class name similar to file name. - Then it will try to figure out the main() method, which is the entry point to the program. - `public` keyword says it is available to the outer world. `static` keyword means you don't have to create an object , you can directly reference with class name like `Basics.main()`, `void` keyword means do not return anything,then we have `main()` method - a function - a portion of code that does something, the command line inputs usually goes into the `String[] args`

```bash
Compile the Java file: Before you can run the Java file, you need to compile it. This creates a .class file. Type the following command and press Enter:

    $ javac Basics.java
If there are no errors, this command will create a Basics.class file in the same directory.

Run the compiled Java code: Now, you can run the compiled code. Type the following command and press Enter:

    $ java Basics
```

- Encapsulation
  - Data hiding
